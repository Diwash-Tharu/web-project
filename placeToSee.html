        <br />Mount Everest Mount Everest is the highest of the Himalayan
        mountains, and—at 8,849 meters<br />
        (29,032 feet)—is considered the highest point on Earth.<br /><br />
        <br />
        Mount Everest is a peak in the Himalaya mountain range. It is located
        between Nepal and Tibet, an autonomous region of China. At 8,849 meters
        (29,032 feet), it is considered the tallest point on Earth. In the
        nineteenth century, the mountain was named after George Everest, a
        former Surveyor General of India. The Tibetan name is Chomolungma, which
        means “Mother Goddess of the World.” The Nepali name is Sagarmatha,
        which has various meanings.<br />
        <br />The first ever recorded people to climb Everest were Edmund
        Hillary (a mountaineer from New Zealand) and his Tibetan guide Tenzing
        Norgay. They climbed the mountain in 1953 and hold the record together.
        The first records of Everest’s height came much earlier, in 1856.
        British surveyors recorded that Everest was the tallest peak in the
        world in their Great Trigonometrical Survey of the Indian
        subcontinent.<br />
        <br />The Himalayan mountains have long been home to indigenous groups
        living in the valleys. The most famous of these are the Sherpa people.
        The word “Sherpa” is often used to mean mountain guide, though it
        actually refers to an ethnic group. The Sherpa have valuable experience
        in mountain climbing, which they can provide to other climbers. Most
        climbs of Everest would be impossible without the Sherpas’ logistical
        help and knowledge. However, their way of life extends beyond helping
        Everest climbers. Traditionally, their lifestyle has consisted of
        farming, herding, and trade. And, because they live at such a high
        altitude year round, they are accustomed to the low oxygen levels.<br />
        <br />Climbing Mount Everest has become a popular expedition for
        mountain climbers. However, it is a dangerous undertaking. Climbing
        Everest requires a lot of experience mountaineering elsewhere, as well
        as a certificate of good health, equipment, and a trained Nepalese
        guide. The snow and ice on the mountain create deadly hazards like
        avalanches, and there is only a limited climbing season due to bad
        weather conditions. But perhaps the biggest danger is the altitude. Most
        climbers are not accustomed to the high altitude and low oxygen levels
        and rely on bottled oxygen they bring along. This is why the area above
        8,000 meters (26,000 feet) elevation on Everest is called the “death
        zone.” Climbers who spend long periods in this region can develop
        altitude sickness and even brain swelling.<br />
        <br />Mount Everest’s climbing industry has become controversial. As
        popularity of the climb has increased, there have been more “traffic
        jams” as climbers spend too much time in the death zone waiting for
        their chance to go to the summit. With more people has also come more
        pollution up near the summit as climbers often discard unwanted items
        all along the mountain. Additionally, the Sherpa people have been
        exploited by climbers, and their traditional way of life has been
        disrupted by foreign climbers. Sherpa guides are faced with some of the
        highest death rates of any field of employment, for comparatively little
        pay. Most disturbingly, because many climbers have died along the way,
        and their bodies are impossible to retrieve, climbers must frequently
        travel past corpses as they make their way up the mountain.<br />

        <br />
        Trekking in the remote region of Dolpo leads through scenic, hidden
        valleys and ancient shrines like Shey Gompa. enjoying fascinating views
        of the pristine waters of Phoksundo Lake, encountering yak caravans that
        cross the high-Himalayan passes and mountain people who live in some of
        the highest settlements on earth like the Dho-Tarap valley; Dolpo is out
        of this world. Dolpo's extraordinary natural beauty was exquisitely
        captured in the Oscar nominated film“Caravan”. Trekking in this
        Himalayan region is an unforgettable adventure.<br />
        <br />Dolpo is confined by the Dhaulagiri range in the south and east,
        Mt. Sisne and Kanjiroba in the west and the Tibetan plataeu towards the
        north. Lake Phoksundo's shimmering turquoise waters never fails to
        fascinate visitors, making it one of the major attractions of Dolpo.<br />
        <br />Settlements here are generally at amazing altitudes of 3,660 m to
        4,070 m and the people are devout Buddhists who have been trading with
        Tibet for centuries. There are 130 gompas (Buddhist monasteries) in
        Dolpo which speaks volumes for their religious fervor.<br />
        <br />One of the delightful moments during the trek is the sight of long
        yak caravans that even today endure immense hardships negotiating the
        harsh, icy terrain, crossing high mountain passes, carrying goods for
        barter to the other side of the Himalayas. <br />

      <br /><br />Little has changed in the way of life for these hardy people
      who strictly follow the customs and beliefs of their forefathers who came
      over from Tibet centuries ago. This trek is an opportunity to meet these

<h1>KUMARI</h1>
</div>
<div class="wa">

<p> <h2> GODDESS <span>KUMARI<span></h2><br>
 <p>   
    
<br>Regarded as a Living Goddess, a young Newar girl with no blemishes is chosen to represent the Goddess Kumari as an incarnation of Goddess Taleju, the tutelary deity of the Malla dynasty and the Shah dynasty which inherited the tradition. Newars are the original inhabitants of Kathmandu valley and have the most elaborate religious festivals. The Living Goddess is worshipped with great reverence and even the Shah Kings followed the tradition of receiving tika and blessings from her. Dating back to the 17th century, the practice was institutionalized by a Malla king.<br>

<br>Legend has it that King Jaya Prakash Malla under the influence of alcohol, while playing a game with the visiting Goddess Taleju in the form of a human, started lusting after her. This offended the goddess and she ordered the king to make an oath that he would select a virgin girl within whom she would always reside. The tradition has been continued to this day.<br>
<br>The Malla dynasty was ousted by King Prithvi Narayan Shah but the tradition of revering the Goddess Kumari was continued by the conquerors. Until 2008, the Shah King would go to the Kumari to receive tika on his forehead which symbolized the empowering of the monarch.<br>
<br>The young candidates from the Shakya caste among the Newars, many as young as four years old, must go through an extremely strict and harrowing selection process before one of them is chosen to represent the Goddess. She must remain calm and show no signs of fear even when put through scary tests. Once chosen, she has to live within the Kumari Ghar (Kumari’s House), her feet must never touch the ground and will leave her residence only during certain festivals. She will remain a Living Goddess until any form of bleeding occurs, which is usually when she reaches puberty.<br>

<br>Visit the Kumari Ghar across Durbar Square, at Basantapur, where she resides and you may be in luck to catch a glimpse of this Goddess. If you are visiting in late August or early September, you may get the opportunity to observe the fascinating festival known as Indra Jatra when the Living Goddess Kumari is carried out of her residence and pulled through the narrow roads of old Kathmandu in a large chariot. It is quite a sight to behold, as masked dancers come out on the streets and the chariots of Lord Ganesh and Bhairav are also pulled along with that of the Kumari by exuberant devotees in a lively procession.<br

<h1>GOKYO VALLEY</h1>
</div>
<div class="sh">
<p><br>One of the most picturesque valleys in Nepal, the Gokyo valley lies towards the west of the more famous Khumbu region of the Himalaya. The serene valley boasts extensive pastures for yaks to graze during summer and the pristine turquoise lakes are simply breathtaking. Gokyo can be visited after trekking up to Everest Base Camp by adding another five days to the itinerary.<br>
<br>If Gokyo is your main destination, then the trek goes up the Everest trail only as far as the teahouses at Kenjoma (where the trail from Khumjung joins the main trail). From this point on, the trail leads up towards Mong La pass before dropping steeply back down to the banks of the Dudh Koshi River. The trail then goes past rhododendron and oak forests and waterfalls which are often frozen. A couple of hours on this enchanting trail and you arrive in Dole, where you spend the night in a teahouse.<br>
<br>From Dole, it is only four hours to Machherma. The valley that leads west above Machherma is worth a visit, and can be done in the afternoon. The valley is dominated by the unclimbed Mt. Kyojo Ri. The final trail up to Gokyo goes past teahouses at Pangkha and up the terminal moraine of the Ngozumpa glacier, which is the largest glacier in the country. Finally, just above the moraine, you will see the crystal clear lakes.<br>
<br>One of the eight-thousanders, Cho Oyu (8,153m) is seen towards the north from Gokyo. There are many great views all around the valley. The most popular among them is seen by ascending a ridge for 2-3 hours to the north-west to reach a small summit. Enjoy a spectacular panoramic view extending from Cho Oyu and Everest, to Lhotse all the way to Makalu. This view is arguably better than what one sees above Gorak Shep.<br>
<br>There are two high passes leading out of the Gokyo valley, the Cho La pass being the most traveled, which leads on to the Khumbu valley near Lobuche while the other is Renjo La pass that joins the trail between Thame and Nangpa La pass. Following the Everest trek route, one takes the alternative exit route as far as Phortse.

From here you walk along the eastern side of the valley through the village of Konar. There are no facilities available on this side of the valley until the small teahouses at Nah, a six hour trek from Phortse. Nah is a good place for camping, but for proper accommodations, one has to walk another four hours to reach Pangkha. From here follow the route described previously.<br>

<h1>POKHARA</h1>
</div> 
<div class="l">
<p>
<br>It is the gateway to the Annapurna region where many a trekker finds his Shangri-La. Pokhara’s spellbinding beauty has been the subject of many travel writers. Its pristine air, the spectacular backdrop of the snowy peaks of the Annapurna Range and the serene Phewa, Begnas and Rupa Lakes, makes this destination ‘the Jewel of the Himalaya’. It is home to exceptionally warm and engaging people and is the starting point for treks into the Annapurna Himalaya, which dominates the skyline. The area along Fewa Tal, the largest lake in the valley, was first a camping ground for trekkers and has gradually developed into the tourist hub of this rapidly growing city.<br>
<br>In the mellow Lakeside area, you’ll find a laid-back attitude as well as a plethora of restaurants, cafés and shops. Because the Lakeside is compact and relatively flat, you won’t need to worry about transportation when you’re in Pokhara, especially if you stay near the lake.<br>

<br>We suggest visiting from October to March. October and November are most popular, because the temperatures are comfortable and the skies are clear, but they also attract the most visitors. In March and April, the rhododendron forests bloom, their flowers offering a glorious grace note to the mountain views.<br>
